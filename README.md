# Image Caption Generator

Image Captioning is the process of generating a textual description for given images. It has been a very important and fundamental task in the Deep Learning domain. Image captioning has a huge amount of application.

Image captioning can be regarded as an end-to-end Sequence to Sequence problem, as it converts images, which is regarded as a sequence of pixels to a sequence of words. For this purpose, we need to process both the language or statements and the images. For the Language part, we use recurrent Neural Networks and for the Image part, we use Convolutional Neural Networks to obtain the feature vectors respectively.


## Dataset Used:  

Flicker 8k dataset, which consists of 8091 images and 5 captions for each image, which makes it roughly 40K captions in total.

The images are in .jpg format and has dimension of roughly 500x600 pixels, which varies per image, the caption is stated inside an excel file with the filename of the images, so that we can map our images to captions.
